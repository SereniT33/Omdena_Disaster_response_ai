# Omdena_Disaster_response_ai

This respository is for the personal tracking of the Omdena local chapter project - Automated Damage Assessment and Mapping for Rapid Response Planning in Natural Disasters. The project description can be found at: https://omdena.com/chapter-challenges/automated-damage-assessment-and-mapping-for-rapid-response-planning-for-natural-disasters/ 

The project is mainly devided into the following sections: Data collection and processing, ML modelling and Deployment. 

## Data Collection & Processing

## Data Modelling
This section follows a 6 step framework for approaching ML projects at https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-1-getting-ready-for-machine-learning/a-6-step-framework-for-approaching-machine-learning-projects.md 

1. Problem Definition
   - We want to **classify** images (i.e. drones, sattelite) into damaged and not damaged.
   - Responders need to **identify and assess** damaged areas using aerial imagery to prioritize response efforts, allocate resources, and plan for recovery. 
2. Data
   - What data do we have? (Structured, unstructured; static, streaming)
3. Evaluation
   - What defines success? Consider false negatives, false positives through the ROC curve and AUC; precision, recall through F1 score
4. Features
   - What features does the data have and which can we use to build our model?
5. Modelling
   - Which model do we choose?
   - How can we improve it?
   - How do we compare it with other models?
6. Experiments

## Deployment
- Model Deployment
- API Development
